Hackathon_Airbnb_Analysis

We have been able to analyse and see trends in Airb&b data set.
On the graphs we can see average prices and apartment types based on neighbourhood groups. 
We also analysed the 100 most popular apartments and we can see their names and locations. 
In addition, we can see the amount of apartments that the top 10 rated landlords own. 
With this data, we will have better tools to understand and eventually decide in which area we want to invest money and what type of apartment we want to buy, and rent.

You can just run the file, all libraries will be installed automaticaly. User just need manualy upload dataset from folder.
